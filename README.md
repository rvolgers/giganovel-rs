# giganovel.rs

This is a Rust port of the `giganovel.py` script which is used as a test file to benchmark programs that find the k most frequent words.

The original Python version can be found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/amakukha/d519f9b09ed593bab9632bf12176c151/raw/03e3cca4f57e3fb20cb737e2704914eaacf7dab7/giganovel.py).

On my system it takes about 30 minutes to generate the 1GB output file. This is obviously an unacceptably large yak, so I set out to shave it.
